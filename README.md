# HAND-WRITTEN-DIGIT-CALSIFICATION
This project implements a simple neural network to classify single-digit numbers (0 to 9). The model is built using TensorFlow's Keras Sequential API.

Dataset: MNIST, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits with black backgrounds and white foregrounds.

Model: A basic sequential neural network designed to recognize and classify digits.

Visualization: Matplotlib is used to display input images and prediction results.

This serves as a fundamental example of digit recognition using deep learning.
