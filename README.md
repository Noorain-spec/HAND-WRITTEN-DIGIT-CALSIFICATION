# HAND-WRITTEN-DIGIT-CALSIFICATION
It is a simple neural network which classify the number in range of 0 to 9(single digits).
This is a basic model which uses sequential model.
Keras was used from Tensorflow to create neural network and matlotlib is used to present the image(number) we take in as input.
MNIST dataset was used to train the model, which has 70,000 samples of single digit numbers in gray scale(background-black and foreground-white).
